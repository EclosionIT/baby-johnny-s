# My Image Page

This repository hosts a simple webpage that displays an image using GitHub Pages.

## How it works

- The `index.html` file is the main webpage.
- The image file (`under_construction.jpeg`) is displayed on the page.
- When GitHub Pages is enabled, visiting the site URL will show the image centered on the page.

## How to use

1. Replace `under_construction.jpeg` with your own image (keep the same filename or update `index.html` accordingly).
2. Commit and push the changes to your repository.
3. Enable GitHub Pages in the repository settings (choose the branch and folder).
4. Visit your GitHub Pages URL to see your image page live.
